Hi! This project is built using the Factory Design Pattern. The subject used for this project was abilities from games. An interface named ISkillCall is created, which all skill classes conform to. Based on user prompt in the main, an AbilityFactory class method is called to determine which skill class is being asked for, and return that to the main where we want the skill that conforms to ISkillCall.
